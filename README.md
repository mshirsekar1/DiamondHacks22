* ✏️ **Efficiency**  
    Hack to improve some process and improve our productivity.  
    Do you wish there were an automated process to fill out job applications? Are you unsatisfied with your current note-taking app? Find a pain point and build a solution!
  
* 🌳 **Environment** </br>
    Set us on a better path towards sustainability.  
    Build a mobile app that sends daily environmental facts or a calculator that compares the environmental impact of various items at the grocery store.  Get creative with how you can help us reduce our environmental impact!
